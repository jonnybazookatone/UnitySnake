UnitySnake
==========

Simple snake game that is to be made using the Unity 3D game engine.

Scripts are written in C# and possibly copies will be implemented in JavaScript.

The user will control the snake head. Everytime a piece of "food" is eaten, the snake's length will increase.
There will exist a score board to count the number of pieces of food eaten and a simple GUI interface to display
the player's name and best scores.
